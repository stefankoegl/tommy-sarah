# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
This is a minimal static web project consisting of two files:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the web page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the web page.

There are no build tools, frameworks, or external dependencies. The project is intended for direct editing and preview in a browser.

## Key Conventions
- All HTML and CSS should be standards-compliant and work in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Keep HTML and CSS in their respective files. Do not inline CSS in HTML unless specifically requested.
- Use semantic HTML elements where possible (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`).
- Use relative paths for linking resources (e.g., `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`).
- No JavaScript is present or expected unless explicitly added by the user.

## Developer Workflow
- Edit `index.html` and `styles.css` directly.
- Open `index.html` in a browser to preview changes. No build or test steps are required.
- If adding new files, update links in `index.html` as needed.

## Examples
- To add a new section, create a semantic HTML block in `index.html` and style it in `styles.css`.
- To change the look and feel, update `styles.css` and reload the browser.

## AI Agent Guidance
- Focus on clear, maintainable HTML and CSS.
- Do not introduce unnecessary complexity or dependencies.
- Document any new conventions or patterns in this file if the project grows.
